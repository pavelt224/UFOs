Java Script Learning: creating a dynamic webpage using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JS

# Project Overview
* The goal of this project was to learn how to take data contained in a JavaScript array or list and organize it into a table that would graphically adjust as "events" changed (i.e. filtering). We utilize Javascript functions to loop through the data to generate the table and develop a customized dashboard in order to react when an element is modified. Filters with event listeners are included in the customizations, which will capture information when an element changes and create an interactive webpage. Filters can be used in a variety of ways. We went over how to display default data in the table, listen for a button click, and update the table based on the user's input with this exercise.

# Results
* When our client first visits the website, they will see the basic opening and title with the photo at the top; as they scroll down, they will see all of the data and filters that we have available (which is in the image below). We have five distinct filters to pick from in the image below: date, city, state, nation, and shape. You can type any of these filters into the search field, and the HTML page will display all of the sightings related to that search. Multiple filters can be input at the same time to dig deeper into the data in the current search box.

# Summary
* We've designed a simple page that allows the user to search through the many sightings in our data set using the search bars we've created. One significant disadvantage of our search bar is the difficulty in validating sightings that can be better explained in the data. Knowing how many people were present at the siting would be useful in authenticating the allegations. Having as much data as possible for the website would make it the best it can be. My two suggestions for improving this website are: 1. to have more data that includes information such as how many people visited the site; and 2. to have more data that includes information such as how many people visited the site. 2. Adding a second filter to detect sightings based on length and, last but not least,
